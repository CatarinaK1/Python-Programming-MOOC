# This program asks the user for three numbers. The program then prints out their product, that is, 
# the numbers multiplied by each other. There is, however, something wrong with the program - 
# it doesn't work quite right, as you can see if you run it. Please fix it.


# Solution
number = int(input("Please type in the first number: "))
number *= int(input("Please type in the second number: "))
number *= int(input("Please type in the third number: "))

print(f"The product is {number}")
